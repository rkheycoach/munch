# munch
This is my first app, using python to develop munch.  This project idea was given by Applause Interactive.  Applause Interactive has a python course on Udemy for beginners and I'm following Applause Interactive and developing munch app.  This is the MVP and hopefully I'll update the app on regular basis as I continue learning.

Munch app will help you pick your favorite dish for the week, so you can plan the grocery shopping list according to the dish you'll be preparing for the dinner during the week.
